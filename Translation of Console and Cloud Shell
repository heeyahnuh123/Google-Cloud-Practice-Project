# LAB: Console and Cloud Shell

## Objectives:

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

  - Get access to Google Cloud.

  - Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

  - Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

  - Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

# Steps:

1. Create a bucket using the Cloud Console.

    #Navigation menu > Storage > Browser > Create bucket > Name(type a globally unique bucket name) > Create

    gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

2. Access Cloud Shell.

    1. Open Cloud Shell and explore features

        #Google Cloud menu > Activate Cloud Shell (>_) > click Continue.

   2. Close Cloud Shell.

3. Create a bucket using Cloud Shell
   
    1. Open Cloud Shell

    2. Use the gsutil command to create another bucket:

        #<BUCKET_NAME> should be different from the globally unique bucket name in step 1

        gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

   3. Check if second bucket is displayed in the Buckets list:

        #Navigation menu > Storage > Browser

4. Explore more Cloud Shell features.

    1. Upload a file to the Cloud Shell VM and copy it to a bucket:

        -Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM and copy to a bucket:

          gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

5. Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell.

    1. Identify available regions

        - To list available regions available for selection, execute the following command:

          gcloud compute regions list

    2. Create and verify an environment variable

        - Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:

            INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]

        - Verify it with echo:

            echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

    3. Append the environment variable to a file

        - Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:

            mkdir infraclass

        - Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

            touch infraclass/config

        - Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

            echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

        - Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the Cloud Console Home page.

            INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

        - Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:

            echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

        - Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:

            source infraclass/config
            echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

        - Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again:

            echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

            Result: There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.

    4. Modify the bash profile and create persistence

        - Edit the shell profile with the following command:

            nano .profile

        - Add the following line to the end of the file:

            source infraclass/config

            #Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano. 

        - Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:

            echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

            Result: You should now see the expected value that you set in the config file.
