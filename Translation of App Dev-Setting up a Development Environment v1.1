# LAB: App Dev: Setting up a Development Environment v1.1

## Objectives: 

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

   - Provision a Google Compute Engine instance.

   - Connect to the instance using SSH.

   - Install software on the instance.

   - Verify the software installation.

# Steps:

1. Creating a Compute Engine Virtual Machine Instance:
   
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

    gcloud compute instances create dev-instance -- subnet "allow-full-access-to-all-Cloud-apis" -- tags http

    gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW --direction=INGRESS ----rules=tcp:80 --target-tags=http

2. Install software on the VM instance

    1. In the SSH session, to update the Debian package list, execute the following command:

       sudo apt-get update

    2. To install Git, execute the following command:

       sudo apt-get install git

    3. To download the Node.js setup script, execute the following command:

       curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -

    4. To install npm and Node.js, execute the following command:

       sudo apt install nodejs

3. Configure the VM to Run Application Software

    1. To check the version of Node.js, execute the following command:

        node -v

        Result: You should see the Node.js version number for version 6.

    2. To clone the class repository, execute the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst

    3. To change the working directory, execute the following command:

        cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/developingapps/nodejs/devenv/

    4. To run a simple web server, execute the following command:

        sudo node server/app.js

    5. Return to the Cloud Console VM instances list, and click on the External IP address for the dev-instance.

        Result: You should see a Hello GCP dev! message from Node.js.

    6. Return to the SSH window, and stop the application by pressing:

        Ctrl+C

    7. To install the Node.js library for Compute Engine, execute the following command:

        npm install

    8. To run a simple Node.js application that lists Compute Engine instances, execute the following command:

        node list-gce-instances.js
